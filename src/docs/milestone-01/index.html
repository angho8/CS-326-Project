            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            For our project, we will be creating a blood alcohol calculator. Our application will calculate an individual's blood alcohol percentage based on their height, weight, health conditions, and how many drinks they have had in a certain amount of time. This application is a great tool for college students due to drinking culture since itâ€™ll lessen the amount of alcohol-based hospitalizations. When first using our application, the user will be prompted to select the health conditions they have. To indicate how many drinks the user has had there will be buttons that will indicate if they had a shot, a beer, a glass of wine, or a cocktail. If the user picks a shot they will be asked to indicate if it was a single, double, or mixed shot, and if they select a cocktail they will be asked to select the exact one from a list of cocktails, then indicate if it was a single or double, as some cocktails contain more alcohol than others. Along with this, our application will tell the user their expected level of drunkenness based on their blood alcohol percentage and will alert the user when it is at or above a dangerous level.

        <section id = "#Application Highlights">
            <h2>Application Highlights</h2>
            Entering the body demographics for the user is a key part of our application. These demographics will be used to correctly identify a user's blood alcohol percentage. When searching for a blood alcohol calculator, there are none to be found that take into account health conditions that may affect the blood alcohol percentage such as MCAS, a rare condition with an allergy to histamines - which there are a lot of in alcohol.

            Another key part of our application is the drink selection. Different drinks have different concentrations of alcohol and will therefore affect an individual differently. Many college students will also drink things such as mixed shots or cocktails that they may not know the exact amount of alcohol included. Our application will find the average amount of alcohol content in these drinks to factor into the calculation.

            The most important part of our application is that it will warn a user when their blood alcohol percentage is calculated to be a dangerous level (0.15). This will indicate to the user that they should not have any more alcoholic beverages until it has lowered. Along with this warning, the application will update the user once their blood alcohol is calculated to be 0.08 to indicate that they are unable to drive a vehicle.
