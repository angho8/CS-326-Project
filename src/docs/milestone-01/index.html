        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        For our project, we will be creating a blood alcohol calculator. Our application will calculate an individual's blood alcohol percentage based on their height, weight, health conditions, and how many drinks they have had in a certain amount of time. This application is a great tool for college students due to drinking culture since it'll lessen the amount of alcohol-based hospitalizations. When first using our application, the user will be prompted to select the health conditions they have. To indicate how many drinks the user has had there will be buttons that will indicate if they had a shot, a beer, a glass of wine, or a cocktail. If the user picks a shot they will be asked to indicate if it was a single, double, or mixed shot, and if they select a cocktail they will be asked to select the exact one from a list of cocktails, then indicate if it was a single or double, as some cocktails contain more alcohol than others. Along with this, our application will tell the user their expected level of drunkenness based on their blood alcohol percentage and will alert the user when it is at or above a dangerous level. </section>
      <section id="Application_Highlights">
        <h2>Application Highlights</h2>
        Entering the body demographics for the user is a key part of our application. These demographics will be used to correctly identify a user's blood alcohol percentage. When searching for a blood alcohol calculator, there are none to be found that take into account health conditions that may affect the blood alcohol percentage such as MCAS, a rare condition with an allergy to histamines - which there are a lot of in alcohol.
        Another key part of our application is the drink selection. Different drinks have different concentrations of alcohol and will therefore affect an individual differently. Many college students will also drink things such as mixed shots or cocktails that they may not know the exact amount of alcohol included. Our application will find the average amount of alcohol content in these drinks to factor into the calculation.
        The most important part of our application is that it will warn a user when their blood alcohol percentage is calculated to be a dangerous level (0.15). This will indicate to the user that they should not have any more alcoholic beverages until it has lowered. Along with this warning, the application will update the user once their blood alcohol is calculated to be 0.08 to indicate that they are unable to drive a vehicle.</section>
      <section id="Data_Requirements">
        <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
        <!-- Related content or subsections -->
        Our application aims to help its users drink more responsibly and foster a safer community. We already know the devastating consequences that can come from alcohol misuse and many people tend to overdrink.
        People are more likely to do things that they often regret or wouldn’t do when they are sober like drunk texting or even worse, drunk driving. Many of these actions are faced with much regret and with more serious things like drunk driving, the consequences could be irreversible and damaging.
        Our application aims to help users avoid making these mistakes and aid them to be more responsible as it can be hard for them to do so themselves when intoxicated.
        Our application will collect data from the user and save the information on its users health and current state. Some of the data it will collect is the user’s body mass, age, height, gender, etc in order to get an idea of the user's current health and state in order to determine how their body will react to certain amounts of alcohol. Leading next into how our application will then access data on the effects of certain amounts of alcohol on various body types.
        In addition it will access data to determine a user’s BAC and calculate the scale of severity for them. It will track the user’s alcohol intake as they progress and consistently update the user’s current blood alcohol content and then determine whether or not the user should continue to drink. The idea is that each user will make their own profile with a username and then enter their information which the application will save and remember for each corresponding user.
        Then the user will update the application each time they consume alcohol in a night which the application will keep record of for the time being and reset the next day. The application will then access the user’s physical data and then compare its library and see what amounts of alcohol will be dangerous to that user based on the data they have saved. Then, it will proceed to warn the user with emojis or pictures since it will be easier for them to understand in that state.
        Our application will depend on data from the user and ongoing collection in order to be able to function as intended. Through the collection of this data we will be able to make efforts to ensure safer drinking and hopefully make users more aware of their drinking habits. In addition, the goal is also to make communities safer overall and teach responsibility.</section>
      <section id="Wireframes">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            Our application project showcases the foundational layouts and structures of key screens of Intoximeter. These wireframes act as visual guides that showcase the basic layout and arrangement of elements without actually going into specific design elements. We created multiple pages for the app which include the Home Page, User Profile, Blood Alcohol Calculator, and Health Results. Each wireframe is designed to allow a clear and intuitive user experience which ensures consistency in design and functionality across different pages.
            <div class="wireframe"><div></div>
            <img src="homepage.png" alt="home">
            The Home Page shows the entry point that welcomes users to the layout that has a search function to allow you to go to the calculator and quick links to other pages. This is aimed to engage users immediately and offer a snippet of information.
            </div><div class="wireframe"><img src="health.png" alt="health">
            The User Profile focuses on providing users with the ability to view and manage their profile including any personal details, underlying health conditions, and other preferences which customize each user's experience.
            </div><div class="wireframe"><img src="level.png" alt="level">
            The Blood Alcohol Calculation utilizes the user’s drink selection to calculate the blood alcohol percentage and shows you at which level your body is at.
        </div><div class="wireframe"><img src="precaution.png" alt="precaution">
            The Health Results takes the blood alcohol calculator results and either gives you a caution to stop drinking, giving you multiple results of what is the best option to go about or gives you an estimate of how much more you can drink.

            <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
            Our blood alcohol calculator, Intoximeter, directly addresses the ongoing issue of alcohol misuse, particularly among college students. Every year, numerous individuals suffer from the consequences of overdrinking, ranging from regrettable actions like drunk texting to severe outcomes such as drunk driving accidents and serious health conditions like alcohol poisoning and even death.
            By providing a tool that calculates blood alcohol percentage based on various factors including health conditions, Intoximeter aims to promote responsible drinking behavior and mitigate alcohol related harm. UMass Amherst, known for its significant Greek life culture asd vibrant social scene, often sees both underage and legal drinkers engaging in excessive alcohol consumption.
            Events like Blarney, with its festive atmosphere, can heighten this behavior. Even those of legal drinking age may struggle to gauge their limits among the pressures of college stress and social obligations. Our project steps in to offer assistance to adults, aged 21 and over, navigating these scenarios. While a user might input false information about the type of drink they consumed, Intoximetger matters because it provides a structured approach to monitoring alcohol consumption and educating users about the potential effects of their choices.
            By enabling users to track their alcohol intake and make informed decision decisions, Intoximeter empowers individuals to exercise self-control and enjoy social experiences responsibility, ultimately contributing to safer communities and preventing tragic outcomes.
