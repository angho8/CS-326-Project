            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            For our project, we will be creating a blood alcohol calculator. Our application will calculate an individual's blood alcohol percentage based on their height, weight, health conditions, and how many drinks they have had in a certain amount of time. This application is a great tool for college students due to drinking culture since it’ll lessen the amount of alcohol-based hospitalizations. When first using our application, the user will be prompted to select the health conditions they have. To indicate how many drinks the user has had there will be buttons that will indicate if they had a shot, a beer, a glass of wine, or a cocktail. If the user picks a shot they will be asked to indicate if it was a single, double, or mixed shot, and if they select a cocktail they will be asked to select the exact one from a list of cocktails, then indicate if it was a single or double, as some cocktails contain more alcohol than others. Along with this, our application will tell the user their expected level of drunkenness based on their blood alcohol percentage and will alert the user when it is at or above a dangerous level. 
        </section>
        <section id = "Application_Highlights">
            <h2>Application Highlights</h2>
            Entering the body demographics for the user is a key part of our application. These demographics will be used to correctly identify a user's blood alcohol percentage. When searching for a blood alcohol calculator, there are none to be found that take into account health conditions that may affect the blood alcohol percentage such as MCAS, a rare condition with an allergy to histamines - which there are a lot of in alcohol.

            Another key part of our application is the drink selection. Different drinks have different concentrations of alcohol and will therefore affect an individual differently. Many college students will also drink things such as mixed shots or cocktails that they may not know the exact amount of alcohol included. Our application will find the average amount of alcohol content in these drinks to factor into the calculation.

            The most important part of our application is that it will warn a user when their blood alcohol percentage is calculated to be a dangerous level (0.15). This will indicate to the user that they should not have any more alcoholic beverages until it has lowered. Along with this warning, the application will update the user once their blood alcohol is calculated to be 0.08 to indicate that they are unable to drive a vehicle.

        <section id = "Wireframes">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            Our application project showcases the foundational layouts and structures of key screens of Intoximeter. These wireframes act as visual guides that showcase the basic layout and arrangement of elements without actually going into specific design elements. We created multiple pages for the app which include the Home Page, User Profile, Blood Alcohol Calculator, and Health Results. Each wireframe is designed to allow a clear and intuitive user experience which ensures consistency in design and functionality across different pages. 
            The Home Page shows the entry point that welcomes users to the layout that has a search function to allow you to go to the calculator and quick links to other pages. This is aimed to engage users immediately and offer a snippet of information. 
            The User Profile focuses on providing users with the ability to view and manage their profile including any personal details, underlying health conditions, and other preferences which customize each user's experience.
            The Blood Alcohol Calculation utilizes the user’s drink selection to calculate the blood alcohol percentage and shows you at which level your body is at.
            The Health Results takes the blood alcohol calculator results and either gives you a caution to stop drinking, giving you multiple results of what is the best option to go about or gives you an estimate of how much more you can drink.

            <h2>Real-World Connection</h2>
            Our blood alcohol calculator, Intoximeter, directly addresses the ongoing issue of alcohol misuse, particularly among college students. Every year, numerous individuals suffer from the consequences of overdrinking, ranging from regrettable actions like drunk texting to severe outcomes such as drunk driving accidents and serious health conditions like alcohol poisoning and even death. 
            By providing a tool that calculates blood alcohol percentage based on various factors including health conditions, Intoximeter aims to promote responsible drinking behavior and mitigate alcohol related harm. UMass Amherst, known for its significant Greek life culture asd vibrant social scene, often sees both underage and legal drinkers engaging in excessive alcohol consumption. 
            Events like Blarney, with its festive atmosphere, can heighten this behavior. Even those of legal drinking age may struggle to gauge their limits among the pressures of college stress and social obligations. Our project steps in to offer assistance to adults, aged 21 and over, navigating these scenarios. While a user might input false information about the type of drink they consumed, Intoximetger matters because it provides a structured approach to monitoring alcohol consumption and educating users about the potential effects of their choices.
            By enabling users to track their alcohol intake and make informed decision decisions, Intoximeter empowers individuals to exercise self-control and enjoy social experiences responsibility, ultimately contributing to safer communities and preventing tragic outcomes.

            <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
            Intoximeter represents the result of our university education and personal growth, drawing from diverse disciplines and life experiences for. Courses in health sciences, data analysis, and user interface design have helped us gain necessary knowledge to develop an effective and user- friendly application.
            Personal encounters with alcohol related incidents have underscored the importance of addressing this issue. Our projects reflect a synthesis of academic learning real-world awareness, demonstrating our commitment to leveraging technology for social good. Intoximeter serves as a testament to our holistic education, integrating technical skills with empathy and social responsibility to create meaningful solutions for pressing societal challengers. 
            CS 326 provided us with the necessary skills to create Intoximeter, which goes beyond just technical ability as it combines responsible drinking advice, health education, and easy-to-use design. Our integrative experience extends beyond the means of the classroom, surrounding real-world issues such as alcohol misuse that is common among college students. By applying theory to practice, we want to address the societal challenger through the development of Intoximeter, which not only calculates blood alcohol percentage but also educates users about the potential risks associated with overtraining. 
            Through integrative learning, we connect skills and knowledge from various sources and experiences, utilizing diverse perspectives to develop important solutions to a pressing social issue.
