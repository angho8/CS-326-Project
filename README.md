Our application will calculate an individual's blood alcohol percentage based on their height, weight, health conditions, and how many drinks they have had in a certain amount of time. 
This application is a great tool for college students due to drinking culture since itâ€™ll lessen the amount of alcohol-based hospitalizations. 
When first using our application, the user will be prompted to select the health conditions they have. 
To indicate how many drinks the user has had there will be buttons that will indicate if they had a shot, a beer, a glass of wine, or a cocktail. 
If the user picks a shot they will be asked to indicate if it was a single, double, or mixed shot, and if they select a cocktail they will be asked to select the exact one from a list of cocktails, 
then indicate if it was a single or double, as some cocktails contain more alcohol than others. 
Along with this, our application will tell the user their expected level of drunkenness based on their blood alcohol percentage and will alert the user when it is at or above a dangerous level.
